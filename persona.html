				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                <p>
                    After finishing college she opened her own store with some help from her parents. It started as a really small neighborhood shop and since then it has become like a mini-market where people can buy anything.
                    Recently she has become more aware of the environment and has decided to start using vegan and environment friendly products around her house.
                    She found the products very hard and thought maybe some other people would like to buy some so she made a sustainable corner in her shop where you can find only products that are good for the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She loves spending time with her family especially having picnics at the lake. Playing games and just enjoying what nature has to give.
                </p>

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
            <p>
                One weekend while driving to the lake she saw that near a kids amusement park are some weeds,no trees to keep some shade or no nice looking grass.
                She thought the authorities needed to do something about it so she started to look for some options,that's how she found the app 'Green City'. 
                She really liked it and kept on using it whenever she saw something like that.
